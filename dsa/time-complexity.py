'''
Asymptotic analysis of an Program :
 - multiplicaition, division, addition are constants operators they are not do n times

 Omega Notation : 
 - It represents the best case scenario of the algorithm

 Theta Notation : 
 - It represents the Upper and lower bound in the running of an algorithm
 - It gives the average complexity of the algorithm.

 Big O Notation :
 - It is useful when it having the Upper bound of the time complexity of the application.
 - It gives the worst case time complexity of the algorithm.
